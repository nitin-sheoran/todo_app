This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

///
1. I created a Todo app which shows a list of tasks on the home screen and has a floating button to create a task.
2. I Have gave a search or short the task Icon in the app bar which is helpful in searching or short ascending or descending tasks.
3. The user can update or delete the task.
4. On due time a notification came to the user.
5. All the tasks are being stored in the Firebase database, the user is not identified due to Don't requirement, hence the user is not identified yet.
6. Provider is used for state Management.
